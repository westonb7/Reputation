# Reputation testing

This directory is for the testing files for the project. Each of the testing scripts can be run individually if you are interested in one specific aspect of the code, or all of the tests can be run together all at once using the testAll.py script.

## Running the tests

To run all the tests at once, navigate to this directory in the terminal, and run this command:

`python3 testAll.py`

To run any of the tests individually, navigate to this directory in the terminal, and run the testing script of innterest using the python3 command:

```
python3 calcTests.py
python3 helpTests.py
python3 primeTests.py
```

If a testing script has run successfully, there should be messages similar to the following:

`Prime test setup funcitoning properly.`

Otherwise, the console should print an error message if there's something wrong.

I'll be adding more testing scripts later.
